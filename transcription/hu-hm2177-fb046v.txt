Originality does not consist 
in moods, in deeds, or stories
Or combinations of mind and
Language different from those
Which have gone before, it
Does not consist only in living
Or all in themes

A melancholy gladness
let me think that this low kind
Of the living forgetting that things of sunny gap
An unknown power they
Debts their hues of saints may heap 
A portion
