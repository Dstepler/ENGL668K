Too then the urn rind
I rue it as hed find a tomb
Underneath this pyramid
Rest thy bones - you here cannot die
Rest thy bones - there is a shame

Where art thou my gentle boy
Did live midst the loving woods
Let me think thy stunt fews
Within its intent mild
The cove of living flowers
Among these tombs and ruins wild

Could I believe that
