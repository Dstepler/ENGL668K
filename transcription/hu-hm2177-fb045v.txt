Think not of gold or flattery vile
He
Thou art not... if a thing divine
like thee, can die- thy funeral shrine
                                heart
Is thy mother's [strikethrough] heart [/strikethrough] & mine
                                grief
                                
μνημη των αγαθων αeι θαλης
WILLIAM
